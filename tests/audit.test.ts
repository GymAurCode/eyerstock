/**
 * Audit-writer guards against the schema it actually has.
 *
 * Migration 018 ("simplify to core inventory") dropped `audit_log` along with
 * the audit viewer. The writer was not part of that removal, so every mutating
 * repository still called `recordAudit` and the write threw
 * `no such table: audit_log` from inside the caller's transaction.
 *
 * The worst of it was invisible for a long time because it broke the one flow
 * every new customer runs first: `auth.setup` died inside `runSetup`, the
 * wizard reported "Something went wrong", and there was no way past it. The
 * end-to-end suite could not catch it either, because the activation screen sat
 * in front of the setup wizard.
