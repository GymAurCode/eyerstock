/**
 * Permission model.
 *
 * Two fixed roles, Administrator and Staff. There is no role editor: the
 * permission matrix is set by migration 18 and by `ensureDefaultRoles`, and the
 * only way to change a user's access is to change which of the two roles they
 * hold. That is deliberate - a small shop does not need bespoke roles, and a
 * fixed matrix is one that can be reasoned about.
 *
 * Modules map to the sidebar entries; `partners` is not a page but is granted
 * with `reports` so the Tax & Partners settings tab can be edited.
